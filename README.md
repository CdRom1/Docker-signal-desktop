# Docker-signal-desktop

This image will:
* download Signal Desktop from the official repo
* install it on a Debian container enhanced with [jlesage's X/VNC dockerized server](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui)

and nothing more.

It is higly customizable, but I'm not responsible for that (jlesage is).
